## FLAPPY CHAEWON

## Description
FLAPPY CHAEWON is a singleplayer game that draws inspiration from the timeless classic of Flappy Bird and K-pop star Chaewon from the group LE SSERAFIM. 

The game is written in C that runs on a GameBoy Advance Emulator with GameBoy Advance controls.

It was created for my CS2110 Computer Organization & Principles class during the Spring 2023 semester.
